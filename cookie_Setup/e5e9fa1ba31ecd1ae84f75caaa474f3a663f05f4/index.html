      <h4>Project Background</h4>
      <p>To comply with global privacy regulations, including  GDPR from EU and CCPA  from California, US, website owners need to provide notice about the cookies on a website before they are dropped, and need to provide controls of the cookies to site visitors. While the privacy landscape taking over the entire world, an increasing number of organizations of all sizes are using our cookie product to help them prepare for these new laws.</p>

      <div class='Img_Onecolumn'><img src="image_cookie/laws.png"></div>

      <h4>Problem</h4>
      <p>The current product was <mark style="background-position:-100% 10%;">originally designed for huge companies with a team of technical and legal persons to work with</mark>. For most marketers and small business owners who have neither technical nor legal background, the current product is bulky and difficult to use. They <mark style="background-position:-100% 10%;">have to invest an extra amount of time learning to use the product</mark>. Therefore, a better tool is in need to enable a more intuitive implementation process.</p>

      <div class='Img_Onecolumn'><img src="image_cookie/question1.png"></div>

      <h5 class='subTitle'><span class="underline--magical">My Contributions</span></h5>
    <p>As the only designer in the cookies team, I am responsible for leading UX and UI across every aspect of our products. I’ve grown tremendously through the project, some key achievements listed below:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><mark style="background-position:-100% 10%;"><b>Improved design process.&nbsp;</b></mark> I educated the team the importance of following a user-centered design process. This helped our team establish more structure on how we conduct usability testing and iterate for the project. </li>
      <li><mark style="background-position:-100% 10%;"><b>Juggled many different hats.&nbsp;</b></mark> Taking the design ownership of Cookie products, I covered all the roles in the design process alone, such as conducting competitive analysis, talk to customers and  talk to colleagues from the professional services team to understand users’ problems,  sketching, testing and designing the product. </li>
      <li><mark style="background-position:-100% 10%;"><b>Achieved the win-win of business goals and user needs.&nbsp;</b></mark> Enterprise UX is usually more about the functionality and helping users accomplish specific tasks in their day to day work. Simplicity is the ultimate goal of problem-solving.</li>
    </ul>

      <div class='sectionTitle'>Research</div>
      <p>Even though I was given the prompt, I needed to break down the project space into achievable tasks and tackle them through a solid design process as well as rigorous collaboration.</p>

      <h4>Defining User Needs</h4> 
      <p>At the outset of the project, I didn't have a clear goal but abstract ideas from product managers. To better understand users’ needs,<mark style="background-position:-100% 10%;"> I scheduled observation sessions as well as focus group discussions with clients of different sizes to answer the following questions.</mark></p>

      <h5 class='subTitle'><span class="underline--magical">Small business owners and marketing persons are the primary users</span></h5>
      <div class='Img_Onecolumn' ><img src="image_cookie/persona.png"></div>

      <h5 class='subTitle'><span class="underline--magical">Users simply want to set up quickly and be compliant</span></h5>
      <div class='Img_Onecolumn' ><img src="image_cookie/user_needs.png"></div>

      <h5 class='subTitle'><span class="underline--magical">The current product is bulky and difficult to use</span></h5>
      <p>After I talked with clients and customer supports, I found people's frustrations generally fell into the following three categories:</p>


      
      <div class='keyTakeaways'>1. “I have to go everywhere to change everything.”</div>  
      <P>Clients complained that even the current tool supports all the functionalities, it's hard to use because all pieces are separate. Even they just want to make a small change like changing button color, they have to go to multiple places to make the change appear on their websites.</P>

      <div class='keyTakeaways'>2. “I don’t know what’s the next step. How can I put the banner I just created on my website?”</div>
      <P>Clients were lost in the configuration process because we didn't provide enough information around where the functions are located and what actions are required to finish the configuration. It's like throwing users into a forest and there is no way out.</P>

      <div class='keyTakeaways'>3. "I need to be compliant but I know nothing about these privacy laws. What kind of configuration settings should I use?"</div>
      <P>Most clients don't have a background in privacy regulations, so it's difficult for them to know what settings are required. And our tool didn't inform users appropriately. Even if some clients have a privacy team in their organizations to consult, it will cause a lot of back and forth. </P>



      <h4>Current User Flow</h4> 
      <p>To better understand what blocks users from achieving their goals, I audit the current design and found the gaps from the current user flow.</p>
      <div class='Img_OnecolumnLargeMore' ><img src="image_cookie/User_Flow.png"></div>

      <h4>Design Goals</h4> 
      <p>Based on the user needs and the gaps in existing products, I summarized the higher-level goals that I hope to achieve with the redesign.</p>
      <div class='Img_OnecolumnLarge' ><img src="image_cookie/designgoals.png"></div>

    <div class='section' id='design' data-aos="fade-up">
      <div class='sectionTitle'>Design</div>
      
      <h4>Proposed New User Flow</h4> 
      <p>The ideation starts with<mark style="background-position:-100% 10%;"> a high-level user flowchart to collect feedback from stakeholders,</mark> including developers and product managers, this has been <mark style="background-position:-100% 10%;">working well for me to inform the team on my design processes and raise UX awareness for the whole team.</mark></p>

      <div class='Img_OnecolumnLargeMore' ><img src="image_cookie/User_Flow04.png"></div>

      <h4>User Feedbacks & Revised Design Goals</h4>
      <p><mark style="background-position:-100% 10%;">All users liked the idea of having a centralized place to manage all configurations</mark> and keep the advanced settings at the current locations. This was reassuring for us that the redesign brings value to users. We also received suggestions that added more to our design goals.</p>

      <div class='keyTakeaways'>- Explain the concept of "Container" at the very beginning</div>
      <p><mark style="background-position:-100% 10%;">It’s too overwhelming to ask users to make the decisions of containers at the very beginning,</mark> especially for new users who are not familiar with the concept of a container.</p>

      <div class='keyTakeaways'>- Add a Setup Wizard</div>
      <p>Based on feedback, I created a refined user flow and <mark style="background-position:-100% 10%;">added a setup wizard in order to educate new users on the concept of "Container".</mark> The new flow got great feeback from stakeholders.</p>

      <div class='Img_OnecolumnLargeMore' ><img src="image_cookie/User_Flow03.png"></div>

      <h4>Wireframes</h4>
      <p>The plan was to have MVP designs ready for collecting clients' feedbacks. So I decided to mainly focus on two parts: Setup wizard & Container. 
      Further enhancements will be built upon the MVP. </p>

      <h5 class='subTitle'><span class="underline--magical">Setup Wizard</span></h5>
      <p>Guide new users through essential steps and help existing users to launch a website quickly</p>
      <div class='Img_OnecolumnLargeMore' ><img src="image_cookie/wizard_wireframe.png"></div>
      <div class='keyTakeaways'>Gather Feedbacks</div>
      <ul>
        <li>The <mark style="background-position:-100% 10%;">sidebar took too much space</mark> and the preview is hard to read</li>
        <li>The <mark style="background-position:-100% 10%;">overview was useless</mark> because users can’t see what they just setup</li>
        <li>From a marketing perspective, we should <mark style="background-position:-100% 10%;">ask what frameworks users are interested directly</mark></li>
      </ul>

      <h5 class='subTitle'><span class="underline--magical">Container</span></h5>
      <p> Bring configurations together for users to <mark style="background-position:-100% 10%;">bulk manage a huge number of websites.</mark></p>
      <div class='Img_OnecolumnLargeMore'><img src="image_cookie/container_wireframe.png"></div>
      <p>However, I got feedbacks that<mark style="background-position:-100% 10%;"> the design is inconsistent with user habits. </mark></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Customers don’t think the way of building a container first then overrides at the website level. They want to set up a website first, then think about how to take all configurations to other websites.</li>
        <li>We should design for the scope of 2-10 conditions.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class='keyTakeaways'>Design Alternatives</div>
      <div class='Img_OnecolumnLargeMore'  style="background-color: white;"><img src="image_cookie/alternatives_wireframe.png"></div>
      

      <h4>High-fidelity Design</h4>
      <p>After a few iterations, I created the high-fidelity interface to illustrate primary functionalities and gather further feedbacks from clients.</p>

      <h5 class='subTitle'><span class="underline--magical">Setup Wizard</span></h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Moved the progress bar to the top, and make the preview more useful.</li>
        <li>Asked users the right questions to find the best solutions.</li>
        <li>Added the preview on the Overview page to give users a clear view of what they just set up.</li>
      </ul>

  <!-- Evaluation -->
  <div class='section' id='evaluation' data-aos="fade-up">
      <div class='sectionTitle'>Evaluation</div>

      <p>Through several review sessions with clients, we received positive feedback for the design solutions. There were also suggestions that we can make the whole process more transparent and understandable. And at the end of the wizard, we can make the transition to advanced container smoother.</p>

      <div class='keyTakeaways'>Enhancement #1: Use a loading animation to inform users what’s happening in the backend</div>
       <div class='small_Img'><img src="image_cookie/01_Wizard_20.png" style="box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(0,0,0,.10);"></div>

      <div class='keyTakeaways'>Enhancement #2: Prompt users for the next step. And allow users to share with their privacy team for review. </div>
       <div class='small_Img'><img src="image_cookie/01_Wizard_19.png" style="box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(0,0,0,.10);"></div>

      <h4>Reflections</h4>
      <p>This is a problem that I've been wishing to solve for a long time. Since I noticed that we have been focused on individual features too much and lost the big picture of the overall workflow. Through multiple iterations, we have arrived at a good solution for now. Two lessons I learned from it are: </p>

      <div class='keyTakeaways'>Ask for feedbacks but don't let users make design decisions.</div>
      <p>We received feedbacks from different stakeholders, like clients, sales teams, customer support teams. All this information allows me to understand the pains and frustrations users experience as they use our product and see problems I might have otherwise missed. However, I can't just take the feedbacks and design a solution based on what users said. I need to dig deeper to figure out users' problems and interpret them to design solutions.</p>

      <div class='keyTakeaways'>Define design scope at an early stage.</div>
      <p>We had a high expectation about this project before started, however it exposed to tons of limitations during the design process. Reasonably planning the design scope of each stage will save time, energy, and eliminate distractions. It will also involve developers in the design process at an early stage to make sure the design is feasible.</p>
