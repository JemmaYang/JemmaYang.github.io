      <h4>Problem</h4>
      <p>Despite the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and accessibility services available at clothing stores, there are still many issues wheelchair users face when purchasing clothing in stores.</p>
      <p>Accessible fitting rooms can be particularly frustrating for wheelchair users. Often they are left messy or used for stocl and storage. It's also common for users without disabilities to use these rooms, forcing wheelchair users to wait in line.</p> 

      <div class='problemStatement'>How can we improve the fitting room experience for wheelchair users?</div>
      
      <h4>Our Process</h4>

    <!-- research-->
    <div class='section' id='research' data-aos="fade-up">
      <div class='sectionTitle'>Research</div>
      <p>We started the project by understanding wheelchair users' current experiences of clothing shopping at physical stores. To answer the following questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What issues do the users face?</li>
        <li>What do they do to encounter this issue?</li>
        <li>What is their motivation to purchase clothes at physical outlets?</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Interview</h4> 
      <p>We Interviewed 4 participants including two wheelchair users, an occupational therapist, and a research scientist who specializes in accessibility.</p>

      <h4>Survey</h4> 
      <p>We launched an online survey with questions about current shopping behaviors, experiences, and opinions. We received 20 respondents.</p>

      <h4>Affinity Map</h4>
      <p>From our survey and interviews, we identified three major problems wheelchair users face when shopping in a physical store.</p>

      <h4>User Journey</h4>
      <p>We conducted an empathy study, wnet into stores to examine how the purchase tasks might be completed by wheelchaire users.
      After the study, I synthesized the findings into a user journey map, which helped my team understand during which phases of purchasing our users faced inconvenience.</p>

      <h4>Persona</h4> 
      <p>To better guide our design and enable everyone on the team to empathize with our users, I came up with the following personas:</p>
      <p>Our key users are adults across a wide range of ages who are not able to stand or walk, and who use wheelchairs in their daily lives. They are strong-willed, independent and go about doing their daily tasks, activities, and responsibilities.</p>

      <h4>Key Insights</h4>

      <h4>Brainstorming</h4>
      <p>Based on our understanding of wheelchair usersâ€™ shopping experience, our team worked on brainstorming multiple design ideas to explore the potential design space, to push the boundaries of design possibilities. After two rounds of brainstorm sessions, we generated more than 30 ideas.</p>

      <h4>Design Concepts</h4>
      <p>We then went through the ideas and considered feasibility, effectiveness, cost, and creativity. Eventually, we settled on the following core functionalities:</p>

      <h4>Sktech & Wireframes</h4>

      <h4>User Feedback</h4>
      <p>After we finished paper sketch and storyboards for our design concepts, we launched a survey and interviewed experts to gather user feedback. We got many valuable insights and reconsidered how we could better design our final solution.</p>

      <h4>High-Fidelity Design</h4>

  <!-- Evaluation -->
  <div class='section' id='evaluation' data-aos="fade-up">
      <div class='sectionTitle'>Evaluation</div>

    <p>5 users helped us perform usability testing. As they performed tasks, we asked them to think aloud. Once the users completed their tasks, we asked several follow-up questions. Then they rated our design through the questionnaire based on SUS. The SUS result is 84.375, indicating that users are very satisfied.</p>
